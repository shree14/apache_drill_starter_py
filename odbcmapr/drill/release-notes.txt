Simba Drill ODBC Driver with SQL Connector Release Notes
==============================================================================

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, and known 
issues in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.22, as well as the version history.


1.3.22 ======================================================================

Released 2018-08-15

Enhancements & New Features

 * [DIRAC-1175] Support for Drill VARDECIMAL data

   The driver now supports the VARDECIMAL data type from Drill. Data of this 
   type is mapped to the SQL type SQL_DECIMAL.

 * [DIRAC-1180] Default user name for No Authentication

   If you specify an authentication type of No Authentication, the driver now 
   uses a default user name of "anonymous".

 * [DIRAC-1174] Updated Drill C++ Client

   The Drill C++ client has been updated to version 1.14.0. In addition, the 
   following patches have been applied to the Drill C++ Client: 
   DRILL-6610 and DRILL-5364.


Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in 
the data source, the driver, or an application.

 * Drillbit sometimes terminates unexpectedly.
 
   Occasionally, a Drillbit will stop working and then drop the connection 
   after running queries for an extended period of time. If this problem 
   occurs, then you will need to restart the Drillbit and open up a new 
   connection. You can determine the state of the Drillbit by connecting to 
   it or clicking the "Test" button in the DSN Setup dialog box.

 * ZooKeeper does not accurately detect the status of a Drill cluster.
 
   ZooKeeper does not detect the status of the Drillbits within a cluster, 
   so it will continue to include non-working Drillbits in the cluster and 
   make the Drillbits available for connections. For example, Drillbits that 
   are unresponsive to Drill client or SQLLine will remain as part of the 
   cluster. An unresponsive Drillbit can cause the Drill client to time out 
   and then reconnect to the cluster. To determine which Drillbit in the 
   cluster is causing the issue, check the Drill client logs, which log the 
   details of the most recently attempted Drillbit connections.

 * In some cases, iODBCTest does not handle SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO correctly.
 
   SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO will cause iODBCTest to stop retrieving data if the 
   data is one of the following:
   - Data where the schema has changed
   - HBase tables that span multiple regions

   This issue does not occur in other applications.

 * The .NET TreeView control sometimes automatically selects the first item 
   in the control.
   
   Drill Explorer uses the .NET TreeView control, and this issue sometimes 
   causes a false preview of the first table/file/directory in the Schemas 
   pane to appear. The behavior is harmless and does not affect the 
   integrity of any data or operations.
   
   For more information about this issue, see the following thread on Stack 
   Overflow:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/800230/windows-forms-treeview-always-selects-a-node-on-focus

 * Microsoft Excel does not allow reserved keywords to be used as column names.
 
   As a work around, do one of the following:
   - Create a SQL view using non-reserved keywords as column names.
   - In the Data Connection Wizard in Excel, before retrieving the data, 
     modify the SQL query to add back quotes (`) around the column name.
   - Use Microsoft Query to retrieve non-problematic columns and then 
     modify the query to add the columns with the reserved names, 
     surrounding the new column names in back quotes (`).

 * On macOS, Microsoft Query does not use schemas when executing queries in 
   the Query View.
   
   As a workaround, specify a default schema in the DSN configuration. 
   However, when working in the Query View, you will only be able to query 
   tables that have the specified schema.

   As an alternative workaround, you can write the queries manually and 
   execute them in the SQL View.

 * On macOS, the Query View in Microsoft Query shows tables but not views.
 
   The macOS version of the driver automatically casts view types into table 
   types for SQLTables calls.

 * Microsoft SQL Server Linked Server compares metadata from SQLPrepare 
   with metadata from the actual query execution, causing mismatches.
   
   When working with views from SELECT * queries, DFS files, and HBase 
   tables, the column metadata from Drill reports the data type to be ANY. 
   As a result, the metadata will not match and queries will fail.

   As a workaround, create views and explicitly state column types. This 
   issue does not occur with views where the column types are specified.

 * Microsoft Query does not call SQLDoCloseCursor() or SQLFreeStmt() when 
   executing subsequent queries.
   
   As a result of this issue, resources from the previous query are not 
   cleaned up, which may lead to "out of memory" errors if many queries 
   are executed.

 * SAP Lumira requires views to work with HBase.
 
   In SAP Lumira, HBase data is collapsed into single columns and not 
   returned properly. To work with HBase data, create views and execute 
   queries against those views.

 * SAP Lumira reports "acquisition failed" error.
 
   The Drill ODBC SAP Lumira Extension requires some DLLs as dependencies. 
   This issue occurs if the dependencies are missing. To resolve this issue, 
   download and install the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Redistributable, 
   which contains the necessary libraries.

 * Parameterized queries are not supported.
 
   You cannot use queries that contain parameters.

 * The Windows version of the driver returns an error when connecting to a 
   local ZooKeeper quorum.
   
   To resolve this issue, add the IP address of the ZooKeeper quorum to the 
   Windows hosts file. The driver will be able to connect to the local 
   ZooKeeper quorum successfully.

 * The Disable ASYNC option affects all DSNs.
 
   Using the Disable ASYNC option disables asynchronous operation for all 
   DSNs.


Version History =============================================================

1.3.21 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-07-20

Enhancements & New Features

 * [DIRAC-1157] Minimum TLS support

   You can now specify the minimum version of TLS the driver accepts when
   authenticating the connection to the data source.
   
 * [DIRAC-1158] Standardized log file names

   When logging is enabled, the driver now produces the following log files:

   - A simbadrillodbcdriver.log file that logs driver activity that is not
     specific to a connection.

   - A simbadrillodbcdriver_connection_[Number].log for each connection made
     to the database, where [Number] is a number that identifies each log
	 file. This file logs driver activity that is specific to the connection.

 * [DIRAC 1159] More informative SSL error messages

   The driver now provides more detailed error messages for TLS/SSL errors.
   
 * [DIRC-6581] Updated Drill C++ Client

   The following patches have been applied to the Drill C++ Client: 
   DRILL-6586, DRILL-6610 and DRILL-6587.


1.3.20 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-06-29

Enhancements & New Features

 * [DIRAC-1135] Shaded Protobuf library
 
   The driver now uses shaded version of the Protobuf library when compiling
   the Apache Drill C++ Client. This helps prevent library conflicts.
   
 * [DIRAC-1148] Improved connection performance
 
   When connecting to a server that supports the metadata API, the driver now
   omits the API call for retrieving the catalog name if the name has been
   specified in the connection information.


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.20.

 * [DIRAC-1146] The Windows connection dialog stops responding when both the
   Catalog and Schema dropdowns are used.
   

1.3.19 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-05-07

Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.19.

 * [DIRAC-1105] Drill Explorer-generated queries in which the schema 
   contains multiple workspaces might cause the driver to over-strip the 
   queries.

 * [DIRAC-1109] [DIRAC-1113] On Windows, large INTERVAL values might cause 
   the 32-bit driver to terminate unexpectedly.

 * [DIRAC 1122] If the driver is installed in a path that contains Unicode 
   characters, SASL is not able to locate the authentication plugins.

 * [DIRAC-1123] The driver reports an incomplete list of SQL_STRING_FUNCTION 
   functions.

 * [DIRAC-1124] The driver reports that it supports cross joins, which are 
   not supported by the Drill server.


1.3.18 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-04-30

Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.18.

 * The driver fails to find the ODBCMessages.xml file in folder if the 
   folder name contains Japanese characters.

   
1.3.17 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-04-06

Enhancements & New Features

 * Error message truncation

   By default, on non-Windows platforms, the driver now truncates displayed 
   error messages to 384 characters. You can alter these settings by configuring 
   the advanced properties ForceErrorTruncation and ExceptionBufferSize. For 
   more information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * Support for username only authentication

   The driver now supports using only the username for authentication. This
   method is intended for servers without any authentication enabled and with
   or without impersonation enabled. 
 
 * Improved metadata consistency across the drivers.
 
   ResultSet metadata has been modified to be more consistent across the
   driver.
 
 * Improvement to catalog name strip logic (RemoveQryCatalog)
   
   Query rewrite logic is improved to make it more robust against string
   literals and prevent unintentional query rewrites.
 
 * Updated OpenSSL support
 
   The driver now uses OpenSSL library version 1.0.2o.
 

Resolved Issues
The following issues were resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.17.

 * During query execution, in some cases the system message "Error creating
   temporary swap file name" may be displayed.
   
 * Delegation UID is not properly updated when set through connection dialog
   prompt by an application.
   
 * The SSL configuration dialog has a visual defect. 
 
 * The driver manager may not be automatically discovered on Ubuntu platforms.
   
 * The Table Type Only catalog function with GetMetadataWithQueries=true
   displays repeat results.
   
   
1.3.16 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-01-31

Enhancements & New Features

 * Error message truncation

   By default, on non-Windows platforms, the driver now truncates displayed 
   error messages to 768 characters. This truncation prevents a known issue 
   with the unixODBC driver manager. The full error messages are still 
   reported in the driver log. You can alter these settings by configuring 
   the advanced properties ForceErrorTruncation and ExceptionBufferSize. For 
   more information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * Updated Drill client support

   The driver now uses Drill C++ Client 1.12.0. This version of the client 
   offers backwards compatibility support for Plain and Basic Authentication.

 * Increased default length for StringColumnLength

   The default length for the StringColumnLength property is now 65535. 
   Previously the default length was 1024.
 
 * Improved Unicode support
 
   The driver is now able to display Unicode characters in returned metadata
   and error messages.   


Resolved Issues
The following issues were resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.16.

 * Invalid authentication type defaults to No Authentication.

   This issue has been resolved. Now, if the driver does not recognise the 
   specified authentication type, it throws an exception.

 * TIME and TIMESTAMP fractional seconds are not properly represented.
 
 * In some cases, Drill Explorer fails to retrieve data when querying tables
   with column names that contain Unicode characters.

   This issue has been resolved. The query statements that the Drill Explorer
   uses to retrieve data have been optimized to enable more robust support for
   Unicode characters.
   

1.3.15.1048 -----------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-01-26

Enhancements & New Features

 * Updated Drill client support

   The driver now uses Drill C++ Client 1.11.0.


Resolved Issues
The following issues were resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.15.1048.

 * Some maprdb files are not displayed in Drill Explorer. 


1.3.15 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2017-11-01

Enhancements and New Features
 
 * Support for TLS
 
   The driver now supports Transport Layer Security (TLS), formerly known
   as SSL.
   
 * Improved Security
 
   Enhancements have made Drillbit to Drillclient connections less vulnerable
   to spoofing attacks. As a consequence, the driver no longer supports
   authentication against Drill 1.10 or lower.
   

1.3.14.1045 ------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2017-11-01

Enhancements & New Features 

 * Prefixes for log file names
 
   You can now configure the driver to prefix log file names with the user 
   name associated with the connection and the process ID of the application 
   through which the connection is made. To enable this feature, set the 
   UseLogPrefix connection property to 1. For more information, see the 
   Installation and Configuration Guide.


1.3.14 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2017-10-31

Enhancements and New Features
 
 * Support for toggling KrbServiceName and KrbServiceHost requirement 
 
   The driver can now be configured to require a Kerberos Service Name and
   Service Host be defined. 
  

Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.14.

 * Queries from Drill Explorer cannot be cancelled. 

 * An incorrect application name is passed to server when using some versions
   of Tableau on OSX.
   
   
1.3.13 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2017-08-28

Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.13.

 * In some cases, incorrect datetime literal support metadata is reported in 
   the Apache Drill C++ client.

 * When using the Drill Explorer on a Linux machine, the application  
   displays the username/password prompt regardless of the authentication 
   method specified.

   
1.3.12 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2017-08-15

Enhancements & New Features

 * Updated Kerberos connection properties
 
   The Service Name option (the KrbServiceName property) and the Host FQDN 
   option (the KrbServiceHost property) are now optional. If you do not
   specify these settings when connecting through Kerberos, the driver uses 
   internally determined default values to connect. For more information, see 
   the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * Minor improvements in the DSN Setup dialog box
 
   Minor internal changes have been made to improve the functionality of the 
   DSN Setup dialog box in the Windows driver.
 

1.3.11 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2017-07-14

Resolved Issues
The following issues are resolved in Simba Drill ODBC Driver 1.3.11.

 * When calling SQLTables with table types that are enclosed in single
   quotation marks ('), the driver returns incorrect results.

   The driver now accepts table types enclosed in single quotation marks and
   returns the correct results, in accordance with the ODBC specification.
 
 * In some cases, when the driver tries to return a long error message in
   response to a failed query, the driver terminates unexpectedly instead of
   returning the error message.
